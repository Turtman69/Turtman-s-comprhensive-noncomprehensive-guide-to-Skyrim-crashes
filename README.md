# Turtmans-comprehensive-noncomprehensive-guide-to-Skyrim-crashes
Resources like Fikthenig's Crash Bonanza are great but don't encompass everything, this was made to try and resolve that. Got an obscure crash that you can only find references to in a Korean forum from 2013? Not anymore! Hopefully.

## This list will not encompass mod dll crashes. That would take forever to compile, and would never be complete.
